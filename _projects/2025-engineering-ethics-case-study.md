title: Engineering Ethics Boeing 737 Max
description: Case Study
---

For class, I was asked to work in a group to conduct a case study on the ethical considerations concerning the Boeing 73 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019.

Some key questions that were posed by the group were:
- Should Boeing have set safety as a higher priority when issues were raise amid rising financial pressures from management?
- Should Boeing have had the authority from the FAA to self-regulate the implementation of the MCAS system in theit commercial planes?
- Should the engineers have disclosed more information about MCAS to the FAA?
- Should Boeing have grounded the 737 Max after the first crash?
- Should the known failures in simulator testing have been disclosed to the FAA?

In pursuing the analysis of these question, we were asked to deturnmine relevant facts about the situation, make reasonable assumptions when facts weren't available, and clarify terms (and when appropriate, how understandings of terms may differe between event stakeholders) when necessary. 
Some facts about the technical aspects of the situation ("Material Facts") are:
- 
Some facts about the decisions of experts in the situation ("Individual Facts") are:
- 
Some facts about the organizational structure and culture ("Organizational Facts") are:
- 

We were also asked to connect these questions to relevant ASME Canons. These were our general conclusion from the exercise:
- 

Lastly, we were asked to identify situational constraints that may have led to suboptimal decisions being made in this particular case.
Some relevant constraint we considered were:
-
