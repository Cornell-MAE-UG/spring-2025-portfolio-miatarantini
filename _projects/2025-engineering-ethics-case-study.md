title: Engineering Ethics Boeing 737 Max
description: Case Study
---

For class, I was asked to work in a group to conduct a case study on the ethical considerations concerning the Boeing 73 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019, with an emphasis on the role of implementation of the software MCAS.

Some key questions that were posed by the group were:
- Should Boeing have set safety as a higher priority when issues were raise amid rising financial pressures from management?
- Should Boeing have had the authority from the FAA to self-regulate the implementation of the MCAS system in theit commercial planes?
- Should the engineers have disclosed more information about MCAS to the FAA?
- Should Boeing have grounded the 737 Max after the first crash?
- Should the known failures in simulator testing have been disclosed to the FAA?

In pursuing the analysis of these question, we were asked to deturnmine relevant facts about the situation, make reasonable assumptions when facts weren't available, and clarify terms (and when appropriate, how understandings of terms may differe between event stakeholders) when necessary. 
Some facts about the technical aspects of the situation ("Material Facts") are:
- There was only one angle of attack (AOA) sensor on the plane with no redudancies
- The MCAS reset would generate repetitive MCAS demands, pushing the plane tip down
- The AOA alert message for conflicting data was surpressed unless explicitly chosen to be enabled by the airline
- The 737 Max was the only Boeing plane without an engine indicator system for the cre
- MCAS overrode pilot inputs
Some facts about the decisions of experts in the situation ("Individual Facts") are:
- Test pilot reported issues with MCAS prior to crashes
- AOA sensor was miscalibrated during a repair
- Keith Leverkuhn, Vice President overseeing the development of the 737 Max, kept a "countdown clock" in the office to "generate excitement" that likely led to increased pressure in the office
- Simulator failures related to MCAS were supressed
- Boeing ignored safety concerns brought forward by Pearson, the senior Boeing plant superviser
Some facts about the organizational structure and culture ("Organizational Facts") are:
- The 737 required no additional pilot training
- The FAA employees believed the FAA wasn't meeting its core safety functions
- the 737 Max was grounded in the US
- the FAA deligated approvals of some systems, including MCAS
- Senior staff aat Boeing head this "countdown clock" present in meetings

We were also asked to connect these questions to relevant ASME Canons. These were our general conclusion from the exercise:
- When priciples of public safety and company loyalty are in conflict, safety should always be the highest priority
- Engineers should also prioritize staying within their areas of expertise over company benefits, as engineers should not regulate themselves
- Public safety should also be prioritized over the protection of proprietary use of technology
- Engineers should also prioritize being truthful and credible over maintaining company loyalty when making public statements (though that is understandably difficult in practice)
It is believed that a prioritization of company interests over other canons contributed to this distaster

Lastly, we were asked to identify situational constraints that may have led to suboptimal decisions being made in this particular case.
Some relevant constraints we considered were:
- FAA staffing limitations
- Regulatory ambiguity producing insufficient results
- Believing that meeting minimum requirements made the plane safe
- Pressure on engineers from management
- Concerns from engineers overriden by management
- Unawareness of the braoder imacts of the MCAS system outside immediate area of expertise

The outcomes of these constraints can be analysed to consider possible routes for prevention of these sorts of disasters in the future, including the suggestions of an internal independent safety review board, internal documentation improvements, whisteblower protections, and less deligation of regulations from the FAA.
