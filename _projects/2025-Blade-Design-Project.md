Wind Turbine Blade Design and Testing

Project Overview.
As part of a four-person team in MAE 4272, I helped design and experimentally validate a small-scale wind turbine blade optimized to maximize power output at a prescribed operating condition. The blades were designed for a wind environment characterized by a Weibull distribution with a mean velocity of 4.59 m/s and were constrained by strict geometric limits, material strength, and a maximum allowable torque and rotational speed. Our objective was to analytically design blade geometry that maximized power at a target rotation rate, then verify performance experimentally in a closed-loop wind tunnel.

Design Process.
We modeled the blade using a blade-element approach with a NACA 4412 airfoil, dividing the 6-inch blade into ten radial sections with independently optimized chord length and pitch angle. Aerodynamic forces were computed using airfoil theory with induction factors to account for wake rotation, and a MATLAB-based parameter sweep was used to identify optimal pitch and operating RPM. Based on this analysis, we selected an optimal design point of approximately 800 RPM, balancing predicted power output with torque-brake and structural constraints. Stress checks confirmed the blades would not fail at the 95th-percentile wind speed before fabrication via resin 3D printing.

Testing and Results.
The blades were tested in a wind tunnel at three representative wind speeds (5th percentile, mean, and 95th percentile of the Weibull distribution). Power curves were generated by incrementally loading a torque brake and recording torque, RPM, and power at steady state. Experimentally, maximum power at the mean wind speed occurred at 750 RPM—within 6.25% of the predicted optimum—validating the analytical design approach. While measured power was lower than theoretical predictions, the discrepancy was attributed to surface roughness, unmodeled tip losses, and wind-tunnel wall effects, all of which were identified as clear paths for future design improvement.

My Contribution.
I primarily worked on airfoil selection, testing protocol, analysis of key assumptions, and contributed to interpreting discrepancies between analytical and experimental results.
